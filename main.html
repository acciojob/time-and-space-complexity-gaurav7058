	<h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the length of the input. An efficient algorithm runs in less time for larger inputs compared to a less efficient one.</p>
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses in relation to the size of the input data. An algorithm with Space Complexity of O(n) uses memory that scales linearly with the input size.</p>
